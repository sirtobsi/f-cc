## 🤔 Assumptions & Design Decisions

Document key assumptions and why you made certain design choices.

### Data Ingestion
- **Assumption 1:** [e.g., "Assumed that duplicates should be identified by identical timestamp + sensor + value"]
  - **Rationale:** [Why you made this choice]
  - **Alternative considered:** [What else you thought about]

- **Assumption 2:** [e.g., "Chose to keep 'BAD' quality readings but flag them"]
  - **Rationale:** [Why]

### Anomaly Detection
- **Method choice:** [Why you implemented certain methods]
- **Threshold handling:** [How you handle edge cases with thresholds]
- **Missing data:** [How you handle NaN values in anomaly detection]

### Metrics Summarization
- **Metric selection:** [Which metrics you chose and why]
- **Aggregation strategy:** [How you aggregate data]

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Be honest about what doesn't work perfectly or edge cases you didn't handle.

### Edge Cases Not Fully Handled
1. **[Edge case 1]:** [e.g., "If all values for a sensor are NaN, my implementation..."]
   - **Impact:** [What breaks or degrades]
   - **Workaround:** [Temporary solution if any]

2. **[Edge case 2]:**
   - **Impact:**
   - **Workaround:**

### Performance Considerations
- **Large datasets:** [How your code scales, any concerns]
- **Memory usage:** [Any memory-intensive operations]
